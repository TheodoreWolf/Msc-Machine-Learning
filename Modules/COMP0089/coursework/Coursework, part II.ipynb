The agent has four possible actions: up, right, down, and left.  Rewards are: `-100` for bumping into a wall, `+100` for reaching the goal, and `-1` otherwise.  The episode ends when the agent reaches the goal, and otherwise continues.  The discount, on continuing steps, is $\\gamma = 0.9$.

    "We used TD to do policy evaluation for the random policy on this problem.  Consider doing policy improvement, by taking the greedy policy with respect to a one-step look-ahead.  For this, you may assume we have a true model, so for each state and for each action we can look at the value of the resulting state, and would then pick the action with the highest reward plus subsequent state value. In other words, you can assume we can use $q(s, a) = \\mathbb{E}[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma v(S_{t+1}) \\mid S_t = s, A_t = a]$, where $v$ is the value function learned by TD as implemented. Then we consider the policy that picks the action with the highest action value $q(s, a)$. You do **not** have to implement this, just answer the following question.\n",
